🌊🗺️ Flood Modeller icons in QGIS? Now you can!

I’ve created QML style files that reproduce Flood Modellers’s symbology in QGIS. Export your networks as shapefiles, load them in QGIS, and they’ll display with the familiar icons and definitions, giving you clearer maps, consistent visuals, and easier spatial analysis.

In Flood Modeller:
- Right click the network in the top-left pane → Export → Nodes as Shapefile
- Right click again → Export → Links as Shapefile
- Load the shapefiles into QGIS
- Apply the QML styles

This is just a glimpse of how we streamline modelling and GIS processes at Arthian. If you’d like expert support with your flood risk or hydraulic modelling projects, get in touch with me (david.hughes@arthian.com) or my colleague Josh Rigby (josh.rigby@arthian.com) to discuss how we can help.
